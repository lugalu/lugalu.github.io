<div class="col-md  fs-5" markdown=1>
iMudei is an app focused on finances for first-time movers. It's a quick and easy way to manage your emergency reserve, set goals and to-do's, and have access to general information and planning tips.

<br>

We developed it because of the steep learning curve involved in moving out of your parent's home, where many people don't know what they should or shouldn't buy and how to do it safely to minimize the chances of having to move back. (Please note that this app is only available in Brazilian Portuguese due to its focus on regional culture, habits, and spending).

### Overview
The overview is a hub where you can see a summary of your goals, everything, and expenses for the month. You can press to activate a graph legend and navigate to all the other screens. The design gives the user a quick summary.

### TO-DO
On this screen, you can categorize the things you need to do or buy according to their priority. One of the recommended uses is the ease with which you can check and uncheck a fixed shopping list of everything you need for the month and add non-recurring items later.

### Tips
The tips screen has various compilations of articles and guides, with their sources cited at the end, which contain how much to put together for a reserve, what to buy for the month's shopping, which electronics to buy first, etc. To make life easier for the user and reduce the overload they may feel.

The team was satisfied with the complete and bug-free MVP. iMudei was our second application and had much more refined things than the first.

### Possible improvements:

1. connection to a bank, preferably iCloud since it's financial data, to make it easier to back up and change devices.

2. Standardize the navigation to something more iOS.

3. expand the functionalities of the finance screen in order not only to facilitate interaction but also to empower the user even more.
