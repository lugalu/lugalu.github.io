Ultramarine: Infinity Dive is a hypercasual, infinity runner game focused on ocean exploration and was our iOS app.  

Its objective is for the user to get as far as possible by competing with their friends on the Game Center leaderboard.

### How It Works

The user can move the character to the left and right of the screen when performing a drag. The player must use the movement to dodge obstacles and collect energy. Energy goes down in the following scenarios:

- Time: as the user plays, it naturally goes down.
- When colliding: unlike most infinity runners, the user doesn't die when they hit a thorn, taking energy away bringing the user closer to dying. We did it this way to avoid frustration over a small mistake.

<br>

One of the main mechanics is as the user descends, the ocean becomes darker, requiring a flashlight to see. This flashlight interacts with the walls and thorns, creating areas of darker penumbra, combined with the speed that gradually increases, making the user need more agile reflexes to avoid collisions.

The user is entitled to one more chance if he dies once on the way down, as long as he wants to watch an advertisement.

<h2 class= "orange-font-color"> Team satisfaction: </h2>

___

The team left happy with the result, most features did not see the light of a day, but for a first app, it's polished, considering most of the team were 1st semester computer science majors.

### Possible improvements:

1. the designer would change the assets to more complex and detailed in order to look more similar and cohesive with the main menu.

2. add the features that were missing, such as fish passing through the background, luminous corals, sounds, and a division by oceanic area (there are many regions, but I'm not sure if it's the right name because I've made this app three years ago), etc.
